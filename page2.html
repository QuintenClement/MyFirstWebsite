        <p style='position: absolute' style='margin-left: 20%'>My life started off in Wauwatosa, WI. I lived there for 3 years of my life before my parents moved us up to Germantown. I lived there with both my parents, my older sister and my two dogs Sophie and Cosmo.
            I attended Germantown's public schools and graduated from high school in 2017. I enjoyed playing sports, riding my bike, and hanging out with friends. My favorite sport was baseball. I played Little League
            for 7 years, then moved up and played with a traveling team for another 4 years. We traveled all over the country including playing in Omaha, Nebraska for the nationwide tournament. After I quit baseball, 
            I focused on school and computers.</p>
